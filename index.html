            <p>My name is Steve Villardi and I am 32 years old. For the past 10 years I have been working in the Professional Services consulting space, centered around Storage, Virtualization and Microsoft technologies. I currently work for a SaaS solutions company where I am a Senior Solution Architect helping organizations with M&A activities surrounding merging and integrating organizations infrastructure.</p>
            <p>Originally from New York, my wife Danielle, my 10 month son Ethan and myself recently moved to FL where we purchased our first home. In my spare time I like to snowboard, skydive, play video games and spend time with my family.</p>
            <p>I have recently decided to make a career change into the full stack development space in hopes of building a future proof career path while enabling me to also develop my own software solutions in my spare time.</p>
